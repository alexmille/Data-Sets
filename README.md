#Welcome to my data sets
I made these files to play with [Tableau software](http://www.tableau.com/), but feel free to use with any other software.

Most files are available in CSV and/or JSON format.

If you find something useful, please [let me know](http://alexandre-mille.com/#Contact).

Current Project(s) :
+ [MLS Salaries](https://github.com/alexmille/DataSets/tree/master/MLS-Salaries)
